# PGDM Documentation

This is a work in progress.

 - [General Concepts](./general.md)
 - [Database Schema](./schema.md)
 - [Table Template Builder](./template-builder.md)
   - Save time, energy and mistakes.  Use this function to create your tables and their required view/functions/triggers.  Also a great resource when for learning how PGDM works under the hood.
